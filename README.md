# What is this?
- This is joke contract of flipper

# Structure description
```
flipper_one.["circuler_flip"]
          |
          V
     communication_base
          |
          V
flipper_tow.["circuler_flip"]
     
```

# Problem
- I was really trying to implement a contract to call "flipper_one" -> "flipper_two" -> "flipper_three".
- I can successfully call up to "flipper_two", but for some reason I get an error when I try to call "flipper_three".
